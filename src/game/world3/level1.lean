# Multiplication World

A new import! This import gives you the definition of multiplication on your
natural numbers. It is defined by recursion, just like addition.
Here are the two new axioms:

  * `mul_zero (a : mynat) : a * 0 = 0`
  * `mul_succ (a b : mynat) : a * succ(b) = a * b + a`

In words, we define multiplication by "induction on the second variable",
with `a * 0` defined to be `0` and, if we know `a * b`, then `a` times
the number after `b` is defined to be `a * b + a`. 

You can keep all the theorems you proved about addition, but 
for multiplication, those two results above are all you've got right now.
I would recommend that you sort out the bar on the left. Fold up everything,
and then unfold just Theorem Statements -> Multiplication World. This will
remind you of your two new theorems, both of which are true by definition.
If you want to be reminded of the theorems you have proved about addition,
you can just open up the Addition World theorem statements and take a look. 
If you don't want to keep opening and closing these menus, why not think
a bit about the logic behind the naming of the proofs? After a while you
might find that you can guess the name of the proof you want.

Anyway, what's going on in multiplication world? Like addition, we need to go
for the proofs that multiplication
is commutative and associative, but as well as that we will
need to prove facts about the relationship between multiplication
and addition, for example `a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`, so now
there is a lot more to do. Good luck! 

We are given `mul_zero`, and the first thing to prove is `zero_mul`.
Like `zero_add`, we of course prove it by induction.
