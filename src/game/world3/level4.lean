## Level 4: `mul_add`

Where are we going? Well we want to prove `mul_comm`
and `mul_assoc`, i.e. that `a * b = b * a` and
`(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`. But we *also* want to
establish the way multiplication interacts with addition,
i.e. we want to prove that we can "expand out the brackets"
and show `a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)`.
The technical term for this is "left distributivity of
multiplication over addition" (there is also right distributivity,
which we'll get to later).

Note the name of this proof -- `mul_add`. And note the left
hand side -- `a * (b + c)`, a multiplication and then an addition.
I think `mul_add` is much easier to remember than "left_distrib",
an alternative name for the proof of this lemma.

/- Lemma
Multiplication is distributive over addition.
In other words, for all natural numbers $a$, $b$ and $t$, we have
$$ t(a + b) = ta + tb. $$
