# Multiplication World

## Level 6: `succ_mul`

We now begin our journey to `mul_comm`, the proof that `a * b = b * a`. 
We'll get there in level 8. Until we're there, it is frustrating
but true that we cannot assume commutativity. We have `mul_succ`
but we're going to need `succ_mul` (guess what it says -- maybe you
are getting the hang of Lean's naming conventions). 

Currently our tools for multiplication include the
following: 

* `mul_zero : ∀ a, a * 0 = 0`
* `mul_succ : ∀ a b, a * succ b = a * b + a`
* `mul_add : ∀ a b c , a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`

and remember also that we have tools like

* `add_right_comm a b c : a + b + c = a + c + b` 

as well as all the addition stuff. These things
are the tools we need to slowly build up the results
which we will need to do mathematics "normally".

/- Lemma
For all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, we have
$$ \operatorname{succ}(a) * b = a * b + b. $$
