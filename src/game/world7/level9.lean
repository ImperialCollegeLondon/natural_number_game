# Advanced proposition world.

You already know enough to embark on advanced addition world. But here are just a couple
more things.

## Level 9: the law of the excluded middle.

We proved earlier that `(P → Q) → (¬ Q → ¬ P)`. The converse,
that `(¬ Q → ¬ P) → (P → Q)` is certainly true, but trying to prove
it using what we've learnt so far is impossible (because it is not provable in
constructive logic). For example, after

```
intro h,
intro p,
repeat {rw not_iff_imp_false at h},
```

in the below, you are left with
```
P Q : Prop,
h : (Q → false) → P → false
p : P
⊢ Q
```

The tools you have are not sufficient to continue. But you can just
prove this, and any other basic lemmas of this form like `¬ ¬ P → P`,
using the `by_cases` tactic. Instead of starting with all the `intro`s,
try this instead:

`by_cases p : P; by_cases q : Q,`

**Note the semicolon**! It means "do the next tactic to all the goals, not just the top one".
After it, there are four goals, one for each of the four possibilities PQ=TT, TF, FT, FF.
You can see that `p` is a proof of `P` in some of the goals, and a proof of `¬ P` in others.
Similar comments apply to `q`. 

`repeat {cc}` then finishes the job.

This approach assumed that `P ∨ ¬ P` was true; the `by_cases` tactic just does `cases` on
this result. This is called the law of the excluded middle, and it cannot be proved just
using tactics such as `intro` and `apply`.

## Pro tip

In fact the tactic `tauto` just kills this goal immediately.

/- Tactic : by_cases

## Summary

`by_cases h : P` does a cases split on whether `P` is true or false.

## Details

Some logic goals cannot be proved with `intro` and `apply` and `exact`.
The simplest example is the law of the excluded middle `¬ ¬ P → P`.
You can prove this using truth tables but not with `intro`, `apply` etc.
To do a truth table proof, the tactic `by_cases h : P` will turn a goal of
`⊢ ¬ ¬ P → P` into two goals

```
P : Prop,
h : P
⊢ ¬¬P → P

P : Prop,
h : ¬P
⊢ ¬¬P → P
```

Each of these can now be proved using `intro`, `apply`, `exact` and `exfalso`.
Remember though that in these simple logic cases, high-powered logic
tactics like `cc` and `tauto` will just prove everything.

/- Tactic : tauto

## Summary

The `tauto` tactic (and its variant `tauto!`) will close various logic
goals.

## Details

`tauto` is an all-purpose logic tactic which will try to solve goals using pure
logical reasoning -- for example it will close the following goal:

```
P Q : Prop,
hP : P,
hQ : Q
⊢ P ∧ Q
```
