## Level 7: `or_symm`

Proving that $(P\lor Q)\implies(Q\lor P)$ involves an element of danger.
`intro h,` is the obvious start. But now,
even though the goal is an `∨` statement, both `left` and `right` put
you in a situation with an impossible goal. Fortunately, after `intro h,`
you can do `cases h with p q`. Then something new happens: because
there are two ways to prove `P ∨ Q` (namely, proving `P` or proving `Q`),
the `cases` tactic turns one goal into two, one for each case. You should
be able to make it home from there.

/- Lemma
If $P$ and $Q$ are true/false statements, then
$$P \lor Q\implies Q\lor P .$$
