# The Natural Number Game, version 1.01.

## By Kevin Buzzard and Mohammad Pedramfar. 

Special thanks to Rob Lewis for tactic hackery, Sian Carey for power world (world 4),
and, last but not least, all the people who fed back comments, including
the 2019-20 Imperial College 1st year maths beta tester students, Marie-Amélie Lawn,
and the people who have been in touch via the <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/" target="blank">Lean Zulip chat</a>

The natural number game is brought to you by the Xena project, a project based at Imperial College London
whose aim is to get mathematics undergraduates using computer theorem provers.
Lean is a computer theorem prover being developed at Microsoft Research.

# What is this game?

Welcome to the natural number game -- a game which shows the power of induction.

In this game, you get own version of the natural numbers, called `mynat`, in a programming
language called Lean. Your version of the natural numbers satisfies something called
the principle of mathematical induction, and a couple
of other things too (Peano's axioms). Unfortunately, nobody has proved any theorems about these
natural numbers yet. For example, addition will be defined for you,
but nobody has proved that `x + y = y + x` yet. This is your job. You're going to
prove mathematical theorems using the Lean theorem prover. In other words, you're going to solve
levels in a computer game.

You're going to prove these theorems using *tactics*. This introductory world, Tutorial World,
will take you through some of these tactics. During your proofs, your "goal" (i.e. what you're
supposed to be proving) will be displayed with  a `⊢` symbol in front of it. If the top
left hand box reports "Theorem Proved!", you have closed all the goals in the level
and can move on to the next level in the world you're in. 

# World 1: Tutorial World

## Level 1: the `refl` tactic.

Let's start with the `refl` tactic. `refl` stands for "reflexivity", which is a fancy
way of saying that it will prove any goal of the form `A = A`. It doesn't matter how
complicated `A` is, all that matters is that the left hand side is *exactly equal* to the
right hand side (a computer scientist would say "definitionally equal"). I really mean
"press the same buttons on your computer in the same order" equal.
For example, `x * y + z = x * y + z` can be proved by `refl`, but `x + y = y + x` cannot.

Let's see `refl` in action! At the bottom of the text in this box, there's a lemma,
which says that if $x$, $y$ and $z$ are natural numbers then $xy + z = xy + z$.
Locate this lemma (if you can't see the lemma and these instructions at the same time, make this box wider
by dragging the sides). Let's supply the proof. Click on the word `sorry` and then delete it.
When the system finishes being busy, you'll be able to see your goal -- the objective
of this level -- in the box on the top right. Remember that the goal is
the thing with the weird `⊢` thing just before it. The goal in this case is `x * y + z = x * y + z`,
where `x`, `y` and `z` are some of your very own natural numbers.
That's a pretty easy goal to prove -- you can just prove it with the `refl` tactic.
Where it used to say `sorry`, write

`refl,`

**and don't forget the comma**. Then hit enter to go onto the next line.
If all is well, Lean should tell you "Proof complete!" in the top right box, and there
should be no errors in the bottom right box. You just did the first
level of the tutorial! And you also learnt how to avoid by *far* the most
common mistake that beginner users make -- **every line must end with a comma**.
If things go weird and you don't understand why the top right box is empty,
check for missing commas. Also check you've spelt `refl` correctly: it's REFL
for "reflexivity".

For each level, the idea is to get Lean into this state: with the top right
box saying "Proof complete!" and the bottom right box empty (i.e. with no errors in).

If you want to be reminded about the `refl` tactic, you can click on the "Tactics" drop
down menu on the left. Resize the window if it's too small. 

Now click on "next level" in the top right of your browser to go onto the second level of
tutorial world, where we'll learn about the `exact` tactic. [NB don't click on "next world",
we're not ready for addition world yet]

/- Lemma : no-side-bar
For all natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$, we have $xy + z = xy + z$.
-/
lemma example1 (x y z : mynat) : x * y + z = x * y + z :=
begin [less_leaky]
  refl



end

/- Tactic : refl
The `refl` tactic will close any goal of the form `A = B`
where `A` and `B` are *exactly the same thing*.

### Example:
If it looks like this in the top right hand box:
```
a b c d : mynat
⊢ (a + b) * (c + d) = (a + b) * (c + d)
```

then

`refl,`

will close the goal and solve the level. Don't forget the comma.
