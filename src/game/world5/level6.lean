# Function world. 

## Level 6: `(P → (Q → R)) → ((P → Q) → (P → R))`.

You can solve this level completely just using `intro`, `apply` and `exact`,
but if you want to argue forwards instead of backwards then don't forget
that you can do things like

`have j : Q → R := f p,`

if `f : P → (Q → R)` and `p : P`. Remember the trick with the colon in `have`:
we could just write `have j := f p,` but this way we can be sure that `j` is
what we actually expect it to be.

I recommend that you start with `intro f` rather than `intro p`
because even though the goal starts `P → ...`, the brackets mean that
the goal is not a function from `P` to anything, it's a function from
`P → (Q → R)` to something. In fact you can save time by starting
with `intros f h p`, which introduces three variables at once, although you'd
better then look at your tactic state to check that you called all those new
terms sensible things. 

After all the intros, you find that your goal is `⊢ R`. If you try `have j : Q → R := f p`
now then you can `apply j`. Alternatively you can `apply (f p)` directly.
What happens if you just try `apply f`? Can you figure out what just happened? This is a little
`apply` easter egg. Why is it mathematically valid?

/- Definition
Whatever the sets $P$ and $Q$ and $R$ are, we
make an element of $\operatorname{Hom}(\operatorname{Hom}(P,\operatorname{Hom}(Q,R)),
\operatorname{Hom}(\operatorname{Hom}(P,Q),\operatorname{Hom}(P,R)))$.

example (P Q R : Type) : (P → (Q → R)) → ((P → Q) → (P → R)) :=
begin
  intro f,
  intro h,
  intro p,
  have j : Q → R := f p,
  apply j,
  apply h,
  exact p,


end
