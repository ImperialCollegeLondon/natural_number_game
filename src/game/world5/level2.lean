# World 5 : Inequality world 

## Level 2 : `le_succ`

Perhaps a natural way to start this level is 

```
rw le_def at h,
rw le_def,
```

and now you can use `cases` on `h` and `use` for the goal.

Pro tip: `rw le_def at h ⊢` does both rewrites at once.
You can get the goal sign by typing `\|-`.

Even pro-er tip: the rewrites aren't actually necessary!
They are true by definition, so actually you can just skip them.
It's more readable if you put them in, but quicker if you don't.

/- Lemma
For all naturals $a$, $b$, if $a \leq b$ then $a ≤ \operatorname{succ}(b)$.
