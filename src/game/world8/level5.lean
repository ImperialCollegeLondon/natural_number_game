# Advanced Addition World

## Level 5: `add_right_cancel`

The theorem `add_right_cancel` is the theorem that you can cancel on the right
when you're doing addition -- if `a + t = b + t` then `a = b`. After `intro h`
I'd recommend induction on `t`. Don't forget that `rw add_zero at h` can be used
to do rewriting of hypotheses rather than the goal.

/- Theorem
On the set of natural numbers, addition has the right cancellation property.
In other words, if there are natural numbers $a, b$ and $t$ such that
$$ a + t = b + t, $$
then we have $a = b$.
